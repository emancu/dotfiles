Installation
============

## Bash

Make sure your `.bashrc` is loads the following file:

    echo "source $(realpath ./profile)" >> .bashrc

## Zsh

Make sure your `.bashrc` is loads the following file:

    echo "source $(realpath ./zshrc)" >> .zshrc


Or just add that line to your `/etc/profile` file.
