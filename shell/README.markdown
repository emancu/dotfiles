Instalation
===========

## Bash

Make sure your `.bashrc` is loads the following file:

    echo "source "realpath .shell/profile" >> .bashrc

## Zsh

Make sure your `.bashrc` is loads the following file:

    echo "source "realpath .shell/zshrc" >> .zshrc


Or just add that line to your `/etc/profile` file.
